# Process_Workshops

The start of my series of workshops as part of Makers Academy where we solve coding challenges whilst a peer reviews us. 

## Week 1 
- Working through a short program to find the leap years and return through multiple clauses whether the year is or is not in fact a leap year. 

- Helped with TDD as a whole.
- Different methods of refactoring and the value of SRP for future projects.
