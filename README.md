# Process_Workshops

The start of my series of workshops as part of Makers Academy where we solve coding challenges whilst a peer reviews us. After a 30 minute coding session we give feedback on the process that we each took and switch roles to assess each others code. 

## Week 1 
- Working through a short program to find the leap years and return through multiple clauses whether the year is or is not in fact a leap year. 

- Learned a lot for my first session watching someone else code and being very methodical how I approach my testing. 

- Helped with TDD as a whole.
- Different methods of refactoring and the value of SRP for future projects.
